# Health-Snap
## This is our Final Year Project
HealthSnap, a mobile app designed to improve healthcare scheduling efficiency and accessibility. Built using React Native and Firebase, HealthSnap offers a user-friendly platform that caters to modern needs, enabling patients and doctors to access its features on iOS and Android devices. The app addresses the demand for flexible appointment booking by providing a mobile-centric solution that enhances convenience and technological capability.
Patients can easily book appointments through HealthSnap, choosing from audio, video, or in-hospital consultations, and access detailed doctor profiles showcasing expertise, experience, and specializations. The app supports secure payment options via Stripe for online transactions and cash for offline payments, empowering informed decision-making. This ensures a seamless and secure experience, meeting diverse user preferences while maintaining accessibility.
To enhance usability, HealthSnap includes an integrated chatbot for instant support and intuitive dashboards for doctors to manage appointments efficiently. Developed with Expo, React Native Elements, and advanced animations via React Native Reanimated, the app offers a modern, responsive interface. Leveraging Firebaseâ€™s real-time database, HealthSnap provides dynamic updates, secure authentication, and robust search functionality, aiming to revolutionize patient-doctor interactions with a scalable, user-centric healthcare solution.
